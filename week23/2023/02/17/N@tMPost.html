<p>Night at the Museum takes place one night near the end of the trimester where students in art and craft classes can show off their progress and work. Classes include 3D Animation, AP Studio Art, Drawing and Painting, Ceramics, CSP, CSA, and more. In CSP and CSA, teams present their final project, while in drawing and painting, students show off their best artpieces. 3D Animation students also present their digital artworks while ceramics students present their sculptures. During this night, all the art students can gather and have fun as they survey all the artworks.</p>

<p>Here are a few screenshots of artworks in 3D Animation.

As I have already taken this course, I know how the class works and what the curriculum is. But, I was still able to take inspiration from these pieces of art</p>

<h3 id="apstudio-art">
<a class="anchor" href="#apstudio-art" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>AP/Studio Art</h3>
<p>Here are a few screenshots of artworks in Studio Art.

I’ve never been good at drawing, so I was fascinated by how the artists managed to make their artwork look realistic, and used shading to create a sense of three-dimensional space.</p>

<h3 id="ceramics">
<a class="anchor" href="#ceramics" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ceramics</h3>
<p>Here is a screenshot of artworks in Ceramics.

I’ve never done Ceramics before, so I have no idea how students are able to mold their clay and then dry them into a sculpture as shown above.</p>

<h3 id="apcspa">
<a class="anchor" href="#apcspa" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>APCSP/A</h3>
<p>Here are some screenshots from the projects in CSP/A

As a fellow CSP student being able to see what my peers have been working on for the past couple of weeks was a cool experience. The CSA project was cool sight to see since the CSA projects were coded using JAVA which was a cool sight to see.</p>

<h3 id="my-own-project">
<a class="anchor" href="#my-own-project" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My own Project</h3>
<p>During the night I was sharing my project to any person who was interested in my project. I was glad that people were finding interests in what I’ve been working and I was more than happy to share what I’ve done.

In this case a fellow CSP student came over and was intrigued in how I’ve done my project.</p>
