<p>In these four instances, a submission is likely to fall short of the standard if it does not clearly explain the purpose of lists, code segments, or the overall program, or if it does not describe how the program operates. It is important to note that defining a program's function is distinct from outlining its purpose. Additionally, a thorough understanding of the code is necessary in order to effectively incorporate it into the response and earn points.</p>
