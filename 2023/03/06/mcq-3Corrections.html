<p>I missed 1 questions which was Q#22. This was due to a silly mistake. I got the question wrong due to a misunderstanding when I was reading the code segment that was given. It showed 2 grids and a piece of code that would move the arrow and it was trying to reach the light grey segment. I had forgot that the code segment would repeat over and over until it either gets stuck or it reaches the end. Which was why I had chose neither grid 1 or 2 would work.</p>

<p>Next time, I will make sure to read the problem carefully, and figure out exactly what it is asking. I can also look at the block of code, if given, more carefully, and comprehend what it is doing.</p>

<p>Here is a screenshot of the results of my Trimester 2 midterm on Collegeboard.
