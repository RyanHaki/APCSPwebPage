## About the Project
This project will be a web page or application that will allow users to interact with the model. The page will display a list of all the fast food restaurants, and each restaurant will have a button that allows the user to create, read, update, and delete their rankings. Additionally, the page will display the average ranking for each restaurant. 

The page will also have a search bar that allows users to search for another user's rankings. The search bar will take the user's name as input and display the rankings that were created by that user.

Finally, the page will have a button that allows users to view the rankings of all other users. This button will open a window that displays the rankings of every user.

## About this View
The View incorporates markdown text with clickable buttons that trigger an action. The Food Items section exemplifies how data will be presented with the current data being used as an illustration.
