### Question I answered incorrectly

Q#16

After reviewing this question I've came down to the conclusion that I once again misread the answer that I chose thinking it was the correct one. So basically what I have to do to not do a similar mistake is to pay attention to the answer that I choose.

Q#23

After reviewing this question I've came down to the conclusion that I once again misread the question thinking it said which of the following task fits for the question. Instead the question was asking which was not a good option. This was why I got this one wrong.

Q#42

I fully clicked the wrong one without realizing. The correct answer would be B two calls to this procedure can be used to determine if a particular word appears in each of two text files. If both calls return true, then the word appears in both text files.

Q#44

For this question I thought it was B even though it was A. B was incorrect since the student cannot modify the search procedureâ€™s code or internal abstractions, the argument passed to the search procedure must be a word, not a definition. A was correct since the student knows that the procedure searches for a value without knowing how it does the searching. This is an example of the use of procedural abstraction.

### Reflection 

Although I did a couple of mistakes on this MCQ most of them were just lousy mistakes so to prevent this on happening on the AP test would be to be a little bit more careful when reading both the questions and answers a lot more carefully.
