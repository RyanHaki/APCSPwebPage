## Summary of Big Idea Quiz 
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Screenshot 2023-03-26 at 1.25.16 PM.png)

This quiz was easier since many of the questions were repeats from previous quizzes. Although I got a 25/25 there were still some problems were it took longer than others.

### Problems I Struggled with

Question 1 

Although I may have given the impression in my earlier thoughts, I was actually very confident in my response. Initially, the range provided was a bit perplexing to me. The fact that there was a range made it unclear that I only needed to determine the minimum number of bits required to accommodate the maximum value.

However, once I grasped this concept, the solution became clear. It just required some mental calculation.


Question 18

Intially I didn't realize that the answer I chose generates the customers who bought any product, not specifically the AA batteries, which is what the question calls for.

### Reflection

I'm not facing any major difficulties with Big Idea 2. However, I believe it would be beneficial for me to work on reading lengthy, information-dense questions.
