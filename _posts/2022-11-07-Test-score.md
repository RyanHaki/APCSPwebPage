### Questions
A lot of the questions consisted of those on collaboration and its benefits. It also asked questions about the Internet, such as protocols and data transmissions. There were also many questions that gave a block of code and asked for the result or an error in the code. A few problems even described programs and asked potential errors, inputs, outputs, and uses. Some questions asked about coding and data types, such as lists, strings, and variables. There were also some questions on binary numbers, algorithms, indexes, sequences, and results of code. Most of these questions were fairly straightforward, but some of them were misleading, and required a lot of thinking.

### What I missed
I missed 5 questions. Most of these were due to silly mistakes. For example, the question asked to choose 2 answers but I only got one of the 2 right. I also missed 1 or 2 questions because I forgot some information about the Internet, protocols, and binary coding. Some problems that included code were also very confusing, often interchanging the values of variables constantly, and then asking for the output.

Question #16: For this question it was asking how messages are transmitted over the internet. I mixed up the answer and I thought the order in which the message is transmitted mattered but it actually doesn't matter.

Question #17: This question tested knowledge on internet protocols. It asked what the use of open protocols were on the Internet. I got this wrong because I didn’t study internet protocols and I forgot what they were and used for.

Question #35: This question gave blocks of code as answer choices and asked which ones performed a specfic function. If the value of a variable of was greater than 120, another variable would be valued as 30, while if the other variable was less than 120, than the variable would be valued as 50. I did get the right answer, but I didn’t see that the question asked for 2 answers. I got this wrong because I only chose one correct answer.

Question #40: For this question it displayed a block of code in which where it would display a value. I hadn't read the full question so I though there would be no value displayed. But something will be displayed no matter what the values of x and y are.

Question #48: For this question it was defining variables and I had mixed up a couple of the variables when answering the question. The value of y is initially 50, but its value is changed to 75 in the fifth statement.

### What I can do better
Next time, I will make sure to read the problem carefully, and figure out exactly what it is asking. I can also look at the block of code, if given, more carefully, and comprehend what it is doing. I also have to remember to study some of the AP CSP materials, mainly those about the Internet, including protocols, and binary coding. I also have to study data transmissions and algorithms.
