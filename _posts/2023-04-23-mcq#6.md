### Question I answered incorrectly

Q#64

Once reviewing this this question I've realized that the option I chose (B,C) which is incorrect. Option B was correct but C was incorrect since when these values, the procedure repeatedly adds -2 to result five times, resulting in the intended product -10. Instead of option C the correct option was D which was correct since y is initially negative, the loop condition count â‰¥ y is initially true, so the body of the loop is never executed and 0 is returned.

### Reflection 

After comparing this MC to the last I took a bit more time when reviewing each question which allowed for me to make less mistakes due to misreading either the question or answer. Yet I still made the same mistake of not reading the whole answer causing me to miss the answer. Although I made significantly less of those mistakes. So in conclusion when I'm going to take the Test early next month I'm going to try and prevent myself from rushing through the test and give myself a little bit more time for each question.
