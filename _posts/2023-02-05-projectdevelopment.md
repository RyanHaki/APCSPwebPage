## Group Project Contributions.
---

During this week we have done some thinking of how we were going to be able to achieve our goal and have came to a new conclusion that we each should start working on separate programs that have a common theme instead of all us working on one main program.

### What I have done this week.

For my portion of the project I have decided on working on a tic tac toe game that will be food themed. 

### What I've done.

I've created the backend portion of my project and a test frontend on the same flask server and I used an extension called live server to test my game. So far I got the basics of the game working where it can detect weather if X or O won or if they ended in a Draw. I used css to style the game and got to a point where I feel comfortable on how it looks at performs.

## What I still need to work on.
---
1. I still need make it so the backend of my code will be on a flask server and my frontend to be on our fastpage. But for that to happen I want our groups aws instance to be up and running.

2. I need to create a database where it can keep track of the games score which gets refreshed after the user is done playing the game.

3. I also need to figure out how I'm going to make the project food themed so it matches the rest of our groups project.
