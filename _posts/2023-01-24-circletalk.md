## 5.2

Some issues that students are having with controlling computing time is dopamine issues. Its something that many issues deal with since they don't have the attention span to last them through time where they have to school work. Something that I deal with personally is not being able to manage the time I spend playing games since I get more dopamine from games compared to school work so to my brain would rather play video games and get that feeling/rush than looking at a textbook. One way that I learned to stop myself from playing video games for a long time is that I set a screen time for myself to restrict the amount of time that I spend playing games. I also dedicated a certain amount of time each day to my school work.
