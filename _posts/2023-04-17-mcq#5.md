### Question I answered incorrectly

Q#41

Once reviewing this this question I've realized that the option I chose (A) is incorrect since the expression assigns only one score to One word, **adjusted Total**. Instead the correct answer was option (B) which was correct since the expression uses the **Max** procedure to replace the midterm score with the higher of the two scores. The selected value is then added to the final exam score and assigned to One word, **adjusted Total**.

### Reflection 

After comparing this MC to the last I took a bit more time when reviewing each question which allowed for me to make less mistakes due to misreading either the question or answer. Yet I still made the same mistake of not reading the whole answer causing me to miss the answer. Although I made significantly less of those mistakes. So in conclusion when I'm going to take the Test early next month I'm going to try and prevent myself from rushing through the test and give myself a little bit more time for each question.
