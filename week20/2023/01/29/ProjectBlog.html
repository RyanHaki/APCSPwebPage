This includes showcasing the program’s purpose and functionality, managing complexity, utilizing algorithms and procedures, testing, and providing detailed descriptions to show proficiency in the project and AP CSP curriculum.</p>

<p>For our CPT group project we have been working on creating a fruit ninja like game where random foods will pop up on screen and the user will have to click. It will have many different aspects to the game such as a score counter, a timer, and effects to the user. There will also be a mandatory feature where users will need to sign in to be able to play so that the leader board can update with their scores.</p>

<p>For my personal addition to this project I will be mainly working on the score and time counter for the game. I will have to make that I am hitting ever single one of the scoring sections of the CPT rubric, and I think I’m making good progress towards that. I am already settled down on the program purpose and functionality, and this will be explicitly described in my writeup &amp; my video. Furthermore, I will be able to test it, and after creating the backend of the score and time tracker page and after it is fully functional, I will be able to go in-depth to describe the algorithms which were utilized, how complexity was managed using lists, and how my backend is secure and utilizes many different complex programming methodologies.</p>

<p>In the video I will show how depending on what object you click how it will effect either your score or time. I will also show how that effects the leader board.</p>
