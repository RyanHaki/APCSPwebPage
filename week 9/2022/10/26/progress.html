<p>One major issue we kept running into was that kept running into merge conflicts when commiting. So to solve this problem we had decided to start using LiveShare. LiveShare is an extension that people can use which can make a repository into something like a shared google doc and makes it where only the host has to commit which lessens the chance of merge conflicts.</p>

<p>During week 1, we created an api that would be able to display a definition of a word which is unknown to the user. Along with this we created the framework for the letters and the hangman. We also finished with the backend part of the project</p>

<p>This weeks plan is to make each letter tangible, create a space where the unknown word would be shown, and create a space where the letters not included in the word and guesses by the user are placed. We also need the program look presentable for the user and to keep updating the word api. Finally make it so the hangman can “grow body parts.</p>
