The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate \"APCSP\" into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. "
