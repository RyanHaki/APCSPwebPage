    "- Algorithmic efficiency is the measure of how effectively an algorithm solves a given problem, in terms of the amount of resources (time and space) the algorithm requires to complete the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Algorithms can be judged on the basis of their time and space complexity. Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by the algorithm to complete its task. Space complexity is the amount of memory or space required by the algorithm to complete its task.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Algorithms with better time and space complexity are considered to be more efficient than those with lesser efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Algorithms can be further compared on the basis of their algorithmic complexity, which measures the number of steps required to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Different algorithms can be compared by measuring the number of operations they require to solve a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Algorithms can also be evaluated based on their scalability, which measures how easily an algorithm can be adapted for different input sizes.\n",
