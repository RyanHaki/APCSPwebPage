    "- Record your findings when testing the time elapsed of the different algorithms.\n",
    "- Although we will go more in depth later, time complexity is a key concept that relates to the different sorting algorithms. Do some basic research on the different types of sorting algorithms and their time complexity.\n",
    "Selection sort/Bubble sort/Insertion sort: O(n^2)\n",
    "\n",

    "Bucket/Count sort: O(n+k)\n",
    "Radix sort: O(nk)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "Time and space complexity are important when choosing an algorithm because you want to choose the algorithm that requires the least space and time to run, so investigating this will help your program achieve maximum efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? \n",
    "\n",
    "You should sometimes use an exponential time algorithm because at lower values and less data values, they can be faster than constant time algorithms. It just depends on how much data you'r eprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm's time and space complexity?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some general patterns I noticed were that loops often determine the time complexity. Look for the general structure of the program as well as nested for loops.\n",

    "\n",
    "for i in range(M): b= b + random()\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: O(N + M) time, O(1) space because the first and second loo pare independent, so you have to add N and M, you can't multiply them.\n",
    "\n",
    "a = 0; for i in range(N): for j in reversed(range(i,N)): a = a + i + j\n",

    "k = 0; for i in range(n//2,n): for j in range(2,n,pow(2,j)): k = k + n / 2;\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: O(nLogn) J keeps doubling until it is less than or equal to n, so log would be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "a = 0 i = N while (i > 0): a += i i //= 2\n",
