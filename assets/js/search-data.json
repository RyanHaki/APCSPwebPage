            "content": "Take some additional notes that you would like here for 3.12 and 3.13. We will be looking for additional notes from the presentation. . Notes . Procedure: A named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. . Can also be referred as method or function, depending on the language Parameters: Input values of a procedure | . Arguments: Specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . Modularity: The compartmentalization and interrelation of the parts of code . Procedural Abstraction: Provides a name for a process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does . Have variable parameters | Code handles different situations depending on how its parameters are set/called | It allows a solution to a large problem based on the solutions of smaller subproblems. What are some other names for procedures?: Another name for procedures are function. Procedure names can be any name we want, i.e. decimalToBinary() | . Why are procedures effective?: Have the ability to alter the result without actually changing the calls to the program . Convenient to change the actions if there is an error in the code Able to break the code up and abstract what different part of the code does; helps identiy bugs, error, etc. | Much better than reviewing code without a procedure (you would have to look at every line by line) | . | . What are procedures? . Fill in the blanks please: . Procedure: is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. . Parameters: are input values of a procedure. . Arguments: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . Modularity: Separating a program&#39;s functions into independent pieces or blocks, each containing all the parts needed to execute a single aspect of the functionality . Procedural Abstraction: provides a name for a process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it. . What are some other names for procedures?: Functions . Why are procedures effective?: We have the ability to alter the result without actually changing the calls to the program . Challenge 1 below: Add the command that will call the procedure. . def DecimalToBinary(num): strs = &quot;&quot; while num: # if (num &amp; 1) = 1 if (num &amp; 1): strs += &quot;1&quot; # if (num &amp; 1) = 0 else: strs += &quot;0&quot; # right shift by 1 num &gt;&gt;= 1 return strs # function to reverse the string def reverse(strs): print(strs[::-1]) # Driver Code num = 7 print(&quot;Binary of num 7 is:&quot;, end=&quot; &quot;) reverse(DecimalToBinary(num)) . Binary of num 7 is: 111 . Challenge 2 below: Complete the Min and Max procedure in either JavaScript and Python using the instructions from the JavaScript page. (JavaScript will get you a extra 0.1) . function findMax(numberA, numberB){ if (numberA &gt; numberB){ return numberA; } else { return numberB; } } function FindMin(numberA,numberB){ if (numberA &lt; numberB){ return numberA; } else { return numberB; } } let maximum1 = findMax(10, 20); let minimum1 = FindMin(10, 20); console.log(&quot;The maximum number of 10 and 20 is &quot; + maximum1); console.log(&quot;The minimum number of 10 and 20 is &quot; + minimum1); . The maximum number of 10 and 20 is 20 The minimum number of 10 and 20 is 10 . Homework/Hacks: For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. . def charToBinary(x): binary = [] for char in x: letter = ord(char) - 64 binary.append(bin(letter).replace(&quot;0b&quot;, &quot;0&quot;)) return binary text = &quot;APCSP&quot; c = charToBinary(text) print(&quot;Original text is: &quot; + text) print(&quot;The binary is: &quot;, c) . Original text is: APCSP The binary is: [&#39;01&#39;, &#39;010000&#39;, &#39;011&#39;, &#39;010011&#39;, &#39;010000&#39;] .",

One hosting service website that is different from Github Pages is Netlify. One advantage of Netlify is that it provides continuous deployment, which means that your website is automatically built and deployed whenever you push changes to your Git repository. This makes it very easy to iterate quickly and deploy changes frequently, without having to worry about the deployment process. Additionally, Netlify provides a lot of other features such as custom domain support, SSL encryption, and forms handling, making it a great choice for static website hosting. . import pandas as pd import requests url = &quot;https://spoonacular-recipe-food-nutrition-v1.p.rapidapi.com/recipes/complexSearch&quot; headers = { &quot;content-type&quot;: &quot;application/octet-stream&quot;, &quot;X-RapidAPI-Key&quot;: &quot;32d5282f94msh36a081cfb06e672p1c2a8cjsn851d00873829&quot;, &quot;X-RapidAPI-Host&quot;: &quot;spoonacular-recipe-food-nutrition-v1.p.rapidapi.com&quot; } # Example query parameters querystring = { &quot;query&quot;: &quot;chicken&quot;, &quot;number&quot;: 5 } response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=querystring) # Check the structure of the response data print(response.json()) # Access the correct data in the response if &quot;results&quot; in response.json(): data = pd.json_normalize(response.json()[&quot;results&quot;]) elif &quot;data&quot; in response.json(): data = pd.json_normalize(response.json()[&quot;data&quot;]) else: raise Exception(&quot;Invalid response data&quot;) # Display the data in a table format print(data.to_markdown(tablefmt=&quot;grid&quot;)) .

The “http” layer is an application layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack, used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It is the protocol used for transmitting data over the World Wide Web. . The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts. The TCP protocol segments the data into smaller chunks called “segments”. Each segment contains a sequence number that identifies its position in the original stream of data, as well as other control information such as source and destination port numbers, and checksums for error detection. . The “ip” layer is responsible for packetizing data received from the TCP layer of the protocol stack, and then encapsulating the data into IP packets. The IP packets are then sent to the lower layers of the protocol stack for transmission over the network. . The “network” layer is responsible for routing data packets between networks using the Internet Protocol (IP). This layer handles tasks such as packet addressing and routing, fragmentation and reassembly, and network congestion control. . Fault Tolerance . Watch both Daily videos for 4.2 .

After reviewing this question I’ve came down to the conclusion that I once again misread the question thinking it said which of the following task fits for the question. Instead the question was asking which was not a good option. This was why I got this one wrong. . Q#42 . I fully clicked the wrong one without realizing. The correct answer would be B two calls to this procedure can be used to determine if a particular word appears in each of two text files. If both calls return true, then the word appears in both text files. . Q#44 . For this question I thought it was B even though it was A. B was incorrect since the student cannot modify the search procedure’s code or internal abstractions, the argument passed to the search procedure must be a word, not a definition. A was correct since the student knows that the procedure searches for a value without knowing how it does the searching. This is an example of the use of procedural abstraction. . . Reflection . Although I did a couple of mistakes on this MCQ most of them were just lousy mistakes so to prevent this on happening on the AP test would be to be a little bit more careful when reading both the questions and answers a lot more carefully. .",

            "title": "Data Structures- Hashmaps, Sets, Hash Tables, Hashing and Collisions",
            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O(n). | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # It gets rid of duplicate values # # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # Since they both can&#39;t have duplicates # . {1, 2, 3} .

Provide answers and thoughts on theoritical question form college board Video in section 4.3. They start at about the 9 minute mark. . Example 1 In the first example it shows a table with 3 different processes with how much time it took to run each. The question is asking how long it would take to run all the processes. (process x takes 50 seconds, process y takes 10 seconds, z take 30 seconds) So it would take a 50 seconds for all 3 processes to run since process y an z would run on one processor while x would take 50 on the other. So max time would be 50 seconds. | Example 2has a table with duration of 2 different processes (process a table takes 25 seconds and process b take 45 seconds). When they run sequentially, they will take 70 seconds as the second process will only begin after the first one is complete.

Heap/Quick/Merge: O(n log(n)) Bucket/Count sort: O(n+k) Radix sort: O(nk) . Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? | . Time and space complexity are important when choosing an algorithm because you want to choose the algorithm that requires the least space and time to run, so investigating this will help your program achieve maximum efficiency. . Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? | . You should sometimes use an exponential time algorithm because at lower values and less data values, they can be faster than constant time algorithms. It just depends on how much data you&#39;r eprocessing. . What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity? | . Some general patterns I noticed were that loops often determine the time complexity. Look for the general structure of the program as well as nested for loops. . Complete the Time and Space Complexity analysis questions linked below. Practice . Time and Space Complexity Practice . a = 0 b = 0 for i in range(N): a = a + random() . for i in range(M): b= b + random() . Answer: O(N + M) time, O(1) space because the first and second loo pare independent, so you have to add N and M, you can&#39;t multiply them. . a = 0; for i in range(N): for j in reversed(range(i,N)): a = a + i + j . Answer: O(N^2) This is a nested for loop, so it runs N*N times. . k = 0; for i in range(n//2,n): for j in range(2,n,pow(2,j)): k = k + n / 2; . Answer: O(nLogn) J keeps doubling until it is less than or equal to n, so log would be used. . a = 0 i = N while (i &gt; 0): a += i i //= 2 . Answer: O(log N) Log is used here because it will sto pafter a certain time. . Which of the following best describes the useful criterion for comparing the efficiency of algorithms? . Time Memory Both of the above None of the above . Answer: Both of the above because you should consider both space and time, to consider the speed and memory the program will take, in order to achieve maximum efficiency. . How is time complexity measured? . By counting the number of algorithms in an algorithm. By counting the number of primitive operations performed by the algorithm on a given input size. By counting the size of data input to the algorithm. None of the above . Answer: By counting the number of primitive operations performed by the algorithm on a given input size . Code . for i in range(n): i=i*k . Answer: O(logk(n)) because the loop goes through k^n-1 times . value = 0; for i in range(n): for j in range(i): value=value+1 . Answer: n(n-1) because the first loop will run n times and the other loop will run (n-1) times. . Algorithm A and B have a worst-case running time of O(n) and O(logn), respectively. Therefore, algorithm B always runs faster than algorithm A. . True False . Answer: False because it depends on what n is. .",

The fact that there was a range made it unclear that I only needed to determine the minimum number of bits required to accommodate the maximum value. . However, once I grasped this concept, the solution became clear. It just required some mental calculation. . Question 18 . Intially I didn’t realize that the answer I chose generates the customers who bought any product, not specifically the AA batteries, which is what the question calls for. . Reflection .

Delete a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses a delete function to remove a user based on a user input of the id. . Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why? DELETE is a dangerous operation because if done incorrectly, it can delete all the data and all the records from the database. | In the print statemements, what is the &quot;f&quot; and what does {uid} do? The use of f makes it an f-string, or string format. The {uid} is a placeholder and the variable will be used within the string. | . import sqlite3 def delete(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to delete&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM users WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (uid,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: # The uid was found in the table and the row was deleted print(f&quot;The row with uid {uid} was successfully deleted&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the DELETE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #delete() . Menu Interface to CRUD operations . CRUD and Schema interactions from one location by running menu. Observe input at the top of VSCode, observe output underneath code cell. . Why does the menu repeat? The menue repeats because it is a sorce of recursion. It keeps going and does the crud operations until the user decides to stop. | Could you refactor this menu?

Some of the big ideas and vocab that you observe, talk about it with a partner ... . &quot;Data compression is the reduction of the number of bits needed to represent data&quot; | &quot;Data compression is used to save transmission time and storage space.&quot; | &quot;lossy data can reduce data but the original data is not recovered&quot; | &quot;lossless data lets you restore and recover&quot; | . The Image Lab Project contains a plethora of College Board Unit 2 data concepts. Working with Images provides many opportunities for compression and analyzing size. . Image Files and Size . Here are some Images Files. Download these files, load them into images directory under _notebooks in your Blog. - Clouds Impression . Lassen Volcano | Green Square | . Describe some of the meta data and considerations when managing Image files. Describe how these relate to Data Compression ... . File Type, PNG and JPG are two types used in this lab | Size, height and width, number of pixels | Visual perception, lossy compression | . Python Libraries and Concepts used for Jupyter and Files/Directories . Introduction to displaying images in Jupyter notebook . IPython . Support visualization of data in Jupyter notebooks. Visualization is specific to View, for the web visualization needs to be converted to HTML. . pathlib . File paths are different on Windows versus Mac and Linux. This can cause problems in a project as you work and deploy on different Operating Systems (OS&#39;s), pathlib is a solution to this problem. . What are commands you use in terminal to access files? The &quot;ls&quot; command is used to display a list of all files in the current directory, while the &quot;cd&quot; command is used to navigate into directories. To read the contents of a file, the &quot;cat&quot; command can be used, and to edit a file, &quot;sudo nano&quot; can be used. | . What are the command you use in Windows terminal to access files? The &quot;dir&quot; command is used to view the list of files and folders contained within a directory. To open a file, you can simply type the name of the file and press the ENTER key. . | What are some of the major differences? The biggest difference lies in the use of different commands to open and access files, such as &quot;ls&quot; vs &quot;dir&quot;. These commands are specific to different operating systems - &quot;ls&quot; is used in Unix-based systems like Linux and macOS, while &quot;dir&quot; is used in Windows. Additionally, the commands for opening and accessing files also differ between operating systems. . | . Provide what you observed, struggled with, or leaned while playing with this code. . Why is path a big deal when working with images? Images are generally more accessible and easier to use compared to other file types. They can be easily viewed, shared, and manipulated using a variety of software tools. . | How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics? Metadata can have both beneficial and harmful effects, depending on how it is used. On the one hand, metadata can provide valuable information about a file, such as the date it was created, who created it, and its file size. This can be useful for organizing and searching for files, as well as for verifying the authenticity of a file. However, metadata can also pose a privacy risk, as it can contain sensitive information that could be used to track or identify individuals. For example, photos taken with a smartphone often contain location data in their metadata, which could reveal where a person has been. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the potential risks and benefits of metadata, and to use it responsibly. . | . Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images? IPython&#39;s inclusion of interactive shells allows for greater interaction between the notebook and the user, making it easier to work with tools such as Pandas and images. This enhanced interactivity provides a more user-friendly experience and enables users to quickly explore and manipulate data. Additionally, IPython provides a range of features that are not available in traditional Python shells, such as tab completion and command history. All of these benefits combine to make IPython a more powerful and efficient tool for data analysis and exploration. | . from IPython.display import Image, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Smiley Face&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;SmileyFace.png&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images def image_display(images): for image in images: display(Image(filename=image[&#39;filename&#39;])) # Run this as standalone tester to see sample data printed in Jupyter terminal if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # print parameter supplied image green_square = image_data(images=[{&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}]) image_display(green_square) # display default images from image_data() default_images = image_data() image_display(default_images) . Reading and Encoding Images (2 implementations follow) . PIL (Python Image Library) . Pillow or PIL provides the ability to work with images in Python. Geeks for Geeks shows some ideas on working with images. . base64 . Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called *Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? Binary uses the numbers 0 and 1, Hexadecimal uses the numbers 0-9 and the lowercase letters a-f. Meanwhile, base64 uses the numbers 0-9, the lowercase letters a-z, the uppercase letters A-Z, and the characters + and / . Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64. Soh = U29o | . numpy . Numpy is described as &quot;The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python&quot;. In the Image Lab, a Numpy array is created from the image data in order to simplify access and change to the RGB values of the pixels, converting pixels to grey scale. . io, BytesIO . Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. In this example, there is a very large picture that lags. . Where have you been a consumer of buffering? One time, during a very stormy weather, I was watching YouTube and the video I was watching started buffering. It paused and there was a loading animation. This was due to the large amount of data that was unable to be displayed due to the slow download speeds. | . From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? A lot of times, the video I&#39;m watching doesn&#39;t load, and sometimes the game I&#39;m playing freezes me in place until I regain connection. . | How do these effects apply to images? When there are large images or very graphic images, buffering tends to occur more. . | . Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and working with Images . Introduction to creating meta data and manipulating images. Look at each procedure and explain the the purpose and results of this program. Add any insights or challenges as you explored this program. . Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed? The code slightly seems like a series of steps. There are multiple functions being performed in order and there are many operations done within each function. | . Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code? The algorithm first receives a scaled size of the image, and data is retrieved from the image. The amount of pixels retreived is then averaged and appended to the data. The image data is then returned. . | Describe scale image? What is before and after on pixels in three images? The scale image scales the height and width of the image to a certain amount. Some images are scaled to a bigger size while others are shrunk. . | Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described? Scale is a type of compression - lossless compression. Original data is not being permanently removed, and instead, the file size is reduced by removing metadata - therefore, lossless. . | . from IPython.display import HTML, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f from PIL import Image as pilImage # as pilImage is used to avoid conflicts from io import BytesIO import base64 import numpy as np # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images # Large image scaled to baseWidth of 320 def scale_image(img): baseWidth = 320 scalePercent = (baseWidth/float(img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (baseWidth, scaleHeight) return img.resize(scale) # PIL image converted to base64 def image_to_base64(img, format): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, format) return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode() # Set Properties of Image, Scale, and convert to Base64 def image_management(image): # path of static images is defaulted # Image open return PIL image object img = pilImage.open(image[&#39;filename&#39;]) # Python Image Library operations image[&#39;format&#39;] = img.format image[&#39;mode&#39;] = img.mode image[&#39;size&#39;] = img.size # Scale the Image img = scale_image(img) image[&#39;pil&#39;] = img image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;] = img.size # Scaled HTML image[&#39;html&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(image[&#39;pil&#39;], image[&#39;format&#39;]) # Create Grey Scale Base64 representation of Image def image_management_add_html_grey(image): # Image open return PIL image object img = image[&#39;pil&#39;] format = image[&#39;format&#39;] img_data = img.getdata() # Reference https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pil-image-getdata/ image[&#39;data&#39;] = np.array(img_data) # PIL image to numpy array image[&#39;gray_data&#39;] = [] # key/value for data converted to gray scale # &#39;data&#39; is a list of RGB data, the list is traversed and hex and binary lists are calculated and formatted for pixel in image[&#39;data&#39;]: # create gray scale of image, ref: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-a-numpy-array-to-an-image/ average = (pixel[0] + pixel[1] + pixel[2]) // 3 # average pixel values and use // for integer division if len(pixel) &gt; 3: image[&#39;gray_data&#39;].append((average, average, average, pixel[3])) # PNG format else: image[&#39;gray_data&#39;].append((average, average, average)) # end for loop for pixels img.putdata(image[&#39;gray_data&#39;]) image[&#39;html_grey&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(img, format) # Jupyter Notebook Visualization of Images if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # Use numpy to concatenate two arrays images = image_data() # Display meta data, scaled view, and grey scale for each image for image in images: image_management(image) print(&quot;- meta data --&quot;) print(image[&#39;label&#39;]) print(image[&#39;source&#39;]) print(image[&#39;format&#39;]) print(image[&#39;mode&#39;]) print(&quot;Original size: &quot;, image[&#39;size&#39;]) print(&quot;Scaled size: &quot;, image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;]) print(&quot;-- original image --&quot;) display(HTML(image[&#39;html&#39;])) print(&quot; grey image -&quot;) image_management_add_html_grey(image) display(HTML(image[&#39;html_grey&#39;])) print() . - meta data -- Green Square Internet PNG RGBA Original size: (16, 16) Scaled size: (320, 320) -- original image -- . grey image - . - meta data -- Clouds Impression Peter Carolin PNG RGBA Original size: (320, 234) Scaled size: (320, 234) -- original image -- . grey image - . - meta data -- Lassen Volcano Peter Carolin JPEG RGB Original size: (2792, 2094) Scaled size: (320, 240) -- original image -- . grey image - . .

In CSP and CSA, teams present their final project, while in drawing and painting, students show off their best artpieces. 3D Animation students also present their digital artworks while ceramics students present their sculptures. During this night, all the art students can gather and have fun as they survey all the artworks. . . 3D Animation . Here are a few screenshots of artworks in 3D Animation. As I have already taken this course, I know how the class works and what the curriculum is. But, I was still able to take inspiration from these pieces of art . . AP/Studio Art . Here are a few screenshots of artworks in Studio Art. I’ve never been good at drawing, so I was fascinated by how the artists managed to make their artwork look realistic, and used shading to create a sense of three-dimensional space. . . Ceramics . Here is a screenshot of artworks in Ceramics. I’ve never done Ceramics before, so I have no idea how students are able to mold their clay and then dry them into a sculpture as shown above. . . APCSP/A . Here are some screenshots from the projects in CSP/A As a fellow CSP student being able to see what my peers have been working on for the past couple of weeks was a cool experience. The CSA project was cool sight to see since the CSA projects were coded using JAVA which was a cool sight to see. . . My own Project . During the night I was sharing my project to any person who was interested in my project. I was glad that people were finding interests in what I’ve been working and I was more than happy to share what I’ve done.

The purpose and the function of this is for users to be able to search any recipe that they like and to be able to find what they want and be givin directions on how to cook the recipe. . Data Abstraction . The function abstracts these details by simply taking an item name as input, and returning a list of dictionaries that represent the search results for that item. The caller of the function does not need to know the implementation details of how the API is accessed, what query parameters are needed, or how the returned data is formatted, it just needs to know the input and output format of the function. . Managing Complexity . The code will divided into smaller modules or functions, such as searchItem function, which is responsible for searching an item in the database and returning a list of results. . Procedural Abstraction . It takes an input item and performs a search on a remote API to retrieve recipe information for that item. The function abstracts away the details of the API request and response handling by encapsulating it in a single function, allowing the user of the function to focus on the task at hand (i.e., searching for recipes) without worrying about the low-level implementation details. . Algorithmic Implementation . The code will provide a complete implementation of a search API that uses an external API service to retrieve data, parse the data, and return the results in a JSON format. . Testing . I can manualy test using tools like Postman to make API calls to the backend and verify that the correct responses are received. . Create Performance Task . Each person in our group will be making a food themed game/feature that follows the CPT rubric. These will all be incorparted together into our N@TM project where users can play the different games and surf through other sites. . Code Plan . My tic tac toe game will be coded using HTML/CSS/Python/JavaScript . The User will be on a Log in screen | Then they will be taken to the rest of the website where they can go to the recipe search | The recipe finder will only work if users are logged in | Users will later be able to log out once their done with their searching. | The account will be saved for later use. | . Video Plan . For the Video I plan to go through the my whole site and show how it will saves the users data. Finally, I would sign and go through my website and be able to search any recipe and then be able to log out. .",

Some problems that included code were also very confusing, often interchanging the values of variables constantly, and then asking for the output. . Question #27: The correct answer to question 27 was D, as shown above. I actually had a difficult time understanding what this question was asking, as I struggled in deciding which answers to eliminate and which answers were possible correct ones. As I am looking back and reviewing this question, I am starting to understand where I went wrong, but I have still not 100% understood this question to the point where I can answer a very similar question like this correctly. One way I can improve myself in this area is to watch some of the College Board videos (also shown in the image above) that relate to questions like these, as those videos will definitely help improve my ability to answer a question like this and teach me how to approach them. I definitely learned a lot about myself and my understanding of this topic from this one question, and I believe that this will help me become better prepared for the upcoming AP exam. . Question #30: For this question, again, I got one of the options correct (option C) but I did not select option B, which was the other correct answer. I did not realize that Option B was correct, because for each next entry, it increases the radius of the circle by 1 (which is supposed to happen as per the diagram), and it starts off with (4, 1, 0) as the initial integers stored which is the starting position of the first nested circle as shown in the diagram. . Question #43: I had mixed up my answer and the correct answer should of been that a limitation to a computer simulation was that the computer makes simplifying assumptions about the real world . Question #45: When reading the answers I had mixed up can and cannot and had choose can instead of cannot leading me to getting the incorrect answer. . . What I can do better . Next time, I will make sure to read the problem carefully, and figure out exactly what it is asking. I can also look at the block of code, if given, more carefully, and comprehend what it is doing.

Harmful Effect: Job displacement and economic disruption in certain industries. . 2.Beneficial Effect: Improved access to information and education through the internet. Harmful Effect: Spread of misinformation and the erosion of critical thinking skills. . 3.Beneficial Effect: Enhanced communication and connection with others through social media and other online platforms. Harmful Effect: Increased feelings of isolation and loneliness, as well as potential invasion of privacy. — . 5.2 . Some issues that students are having with controlling computing time is dopamine issues. Its something that many issues deal with since they don’t have the attention span to last them through time where they have to school work. Something that I deal with personally is not being able to manage the time I spend playing games since I get more dopamine from games compared to school work so to my brain would rather play video games and get that feeling/rush than looking at a textbook. One way that I learned to stop myself from playing video games for a long time is that I set a screen time for myself to restrict the amount of time that I spend playing games. I also dedicated a certain amount of time each day to my school work. . . 5.3 . Algorithmic Bias . Computer bias frequently manifests as algorithmic bias. These algorithms tend to cater to specific target markets, for instance, Facebook displays ads that attract an older audience while TikTok is geared towards a younger demographic. . The topic of gender-based biases in artificial intelligence systems was extensively debated. Despite evidence of gender stereotyping being present in the decision-making process, the team ultimately concluded that the multitude of voice options and the likelihood that the creators used consumer data to determine the most popular voice led to the female default being chosen as it simply resonated with the majority. . Algorithms are prevalent in applications that aim to keep users engaged, such as YouTube, Instagram, Netflix, Amazon, and others. While it can have negative consequences if, for example, a user is exposed to only a single political viewpoint on YouTube, in general, these algorithms benefit both the user and the platform. By personalizing content based on previous viewing habits, sites such as Netflix and YouTube improve their ability to recommend media that the user is likely to enjoy, which can be considered a mutually advantageous outcome. . Are HP Computers Racist? . While the data regarding HP testers is certainly concerning and indicative of a lack of inclusivity and responsibility, there is no clear evidence of deliberate discrimination. Regardless, this is a harmful flaw in the camera’s programming, and it is the responsibility of HP for failing to identify it. . To prevent similar issues in the future, it is crucial to conduct comprehensive testing on systems, especially those designed to interact with individuals of varying appearances, with a diverse group of testers. One effective method to gather extensive data could be to record a diverse range of individuals in a public setting. . 5.4 . CompSci has 150ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment. | . It would be beneficial to receive feedback on the games featured on our website from other CSP students, as it may provide us with more comprehensive solutions or recommendations for various challenges. This approach can be applied to all aspects of our project and could be initiated through Slack. . What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? | . Testing the Reviews and Events databases with a diverse group of students would be beneficial as it would provide more robust testing for their filtering and validation systems with a higher volume of entries. If we were to enlist a significant number of Del Norte students to contribute events and reviews to the site, we would have a stronger foundation to build upon. However, this approach would also come with the potential risk of an increase in spam. . 5.5 . Notes . Creating a repository on GitHub requires selection of a license type. | There are many lawyers who specialize in patents. | Qualcomm seeks compensation for derivative works and demands a royalty fee for the use of patents and ideas. | Using software under the GPL license may result in the loss of the ability to charge for the software and related patents. | The GPL open source license requires that any derivative work must be free and the code must be shared. | The cost of using software under the GPL license may be higher than expected due to the loss of the right to charge for the software and patents. | Open source licenses like the GPL have clear guidelines for sharing and distributing derivative works. | Companies such as Qualcomm strive to receive reimbursement for the usage of their patents and ideas, even in the context of open source software. | . Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal . The Creative Commons CC0 Public Domain Dedication waives all copyright claims on a work you have created, making it accessible to the public globally. . Open Source MIT License . The MIT License permits the unrestricted use of code and the production and distribution of proprietary versions. Typically, the software author under the MIT License desires recognition, which can be as simple as including their name in the comments. Proprietary projects can be kept confidential on GitHub. . 5.6 . Notes . Personal Identifiable Information (PII) refers to information that can identify a person. | This information can be easily obtained through social media, online searches, and other online activities. | It is important to be mindful of the information shared online, as it can be easily accessible by others. | Confidential information such as financial credentials, two-factor authentication codes, and social security numbers should be kept private. | Multi-factor authentication and biometric methods can increase the security of your systems. | Both Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption can also boost the security of your systems. | Phishing and malware attacks pose a threat to the security of your PII. | Regularly reviewing your PII vulnerabilities and taking measures to protect your information is crucial. | . 1) Personal Identifiable Information (PII) encompasses details that can identify a person, such as their name, social security number, date of birth, address, or phone number. Websites, apps, and organizations often gather and store PII in the field of computer science. In a project I encountered, PII was gathered from users through the registration process and utilized to customize their website experience. . 2) The revelation of PII can lead to severe consequences for individuals, including identity theft, financial fraud, and privacy breaches. Hence, it is crucial for organizations to securely manage and protect PII to prevent such incidents from taking place. Strong passwords are usually lengthy, complex, and unpredictable, making them challenging to guess or crack. In contrast, weak passwords are short, easily predictable, or frequently used. Two-factor authentication (2FA) can also be used to enhance authentication by requiring two forms of identification, such as something you know (such as a password) and something you possess (such as a smartphone), to access an account. . 3) Symmetric encryption is a technique where a single key is employed for both encryption and decryption. As a result, both the sender and receiver of the encrypted message must have access to the identical key for secure communication. Conversely, asymmetric encryption utilizes two distinct keys: one for encryption and another for decryption. This allows for secure communication between parties without the need for pre-exchanging the key. . 4) An instance of encryption utilized in AWS deployment is the implementation of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates, which encrypt the communication between a user’s browser and a website to protect against eavesdropping and tampering. . 5) To date, I have not fallen victim to any phishing scams. One type of phishing scam I am aware of involves an attacker sending an email that appears to come from a trusted source, such as a bank or e-commerce site, and requesting the recipient to click on a link or provide confidential information. Another popular phishing method involves creating a fake login page that mimics a legitimate website to deceive the user into entering their username and password. Additionally, phishing can also be carried out through malicious attachments. .",

Libraries . Okay, so we&#39;ve learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there&#39;s a more advanced program you don&#39;t know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. . You&#39;ve already learned about functions that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user? . Packages allow a python user to import methods from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most libraries come with documentation on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick google search. methods are used with the following: . Note: a method from a package can only be used after the import statement. . Some libraries are always installed, such as those with the list methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called import. We will learn different ways to import in Challenge 1. . Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word &quot;from&quot;, followed by the package name, then the word import, then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package&#39;s name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use &quot;*&quot;. . To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word &quot;as&quot;, and write the name you would like to use that package as. . Challenge 1: Basic Libraries . Find a python package on the internet and import it | Choose a method from the package and import only the method | import the package as a more convenient name. | from random import randint randint(2006,2022) . 2020 . Challenge 2: Turtle . Turtle is a python drawing package which allows you to draw all kinds of different shapes. It&#39;s ofter used to teach beginning python learners, but is really cool to use anywhere. Turtle employs a graphics package to display what you&#39;ve done, but unfortunately it&#39;s kind of annoying to make work with vscode. Use: repl.it Click &quot;+ Create&quot;, and for language, select &quot;Python (with Turtle)&quot; Documentation Task: Have fun with turtle! Create something that uses at least 2 lines of different lengths and 2 turns with different angles, and changes at least one setting about either the pen or canvas. Also use one command that isn&#39;t mentioned on the table below(there are a lot). Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Commands . forward(pixels) | . right(degrees) | . left(degrees) | . setpos(x,y) | . speed(speed) | . pensize(size) | . pencolor(color) | . Note: Color should be within quotes, like &quot;brown&quot;, or &quot;red&quot; . Challenge 3: Math . The math package allows for some really cool mathematical methods! . methods Action . ceil(x) | will return whatever the next highest interger | . x | rounds to largest intefer less than or equal to x | . factorial(x) | reutrns the factorial | . gcf(x,y) | returns the greatest common denominator of x and y | . lcm(x,y) | returns the least common denominator | . Challenge: Create a program which asks for a user input of two numbers, and returns the following: . each number rounded up | each number rounded down | the lcm of the rounded down numbers | the gcf of the rounded up numbers | the factorial of each number | something else using the math package! Documentation | . from math import * def coolmath(x, y): upx = ceil(x) upy = ceil(y) downx = floor(x) downy = floor(y) a = lcm(downx, downy) b = gcd(upx, upy) facx = factorial(abs(upx)) facy = factorial(abs(upy)) rootx = sqrt(abs(x)) rooty = sqrt(abs(y)) return(upx, upy, downx, downy, a, b, facx, facy, rootx, rooty) x = input(&quot;Enter first number&quot;) y = input(&quot;Enter second number&quot;) coolmath(float(x), float(y)) .

Option 1: Create a python program which generates a random number between 1 and 10, and use turtle to draw a regular polygon with that many sides. As a hint, remember that the total sum of all the angles in a polygon is (the number of sides - 2) * 180. Note: a regular polygon has all sides and angles the same size. Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Option 2: use the &quot;datetime&quot; package, and looking up documentation, create a program to generate 2 random dates and find the number of days between . Extra ideas: customize the settings, draw a picture, or something else! . import datetime # Generate two random dates date_1 = datetime.date(2020, 5, 6) date_2 = datetime.date(2019, 3, 10) # Find the difference between dates difference = date_1 - date_2 # Print the number of days between the two dates print(&quot;The number of days between the two dates is:&quot;, difference.days) . The number of days between the two dates is: 423 .",

The most intuitively obvious solution to the searching problem is to sequentialy check each successful value in the data structure until either a matching value is found, or the entire structure has been transversed. This thought process could be explained graphically in this example . This algorithm could also be expressed in code, as shown below. . def sequentialSearch(arr, target): N = len(arr) # Declare N as length of array for i in range(N): # Iterate over the list if arr[i] == target: # Check for match return i # Match found, return index and end function call return -1 # Element not found . Sequential Search - Larger Inputs . Although for selection sort is seemingly fast for smaller inputs, it is clear that it cannot keep up with increasing input sizes. Because sequential search checks every value of the given array, the algorithm&#39;s overall runtime increases &quot;linearly&quot; with the input size. . i.e. Pretend that one check takes one second, and that we are searching for the last element in an array. If the array length is 4, it would take 4 seconds to find the last element, whereas if the array length is 86400 indices long, it would take a whole day to find the element. . Hence, although selection sort is known for its simplicity, it is unfeasible for large inputs . Below, we have created three sorted lists of length 100,1000000,100000000. . import time arr1 = [i for i in range(100)] arr2 = [i for i in range(1000000)] arr3 = [i for i in range(100000000)] . To analyze the sequential search algorithm, we will check for the worst case scenario, where runtime is maximized. This is because when measuring the efficiency of our algorithm, we want to be able to guarantee an upper limit or set amount of time for our program to finish running. To do this, we will attempt to search for the last element in the array . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05602836608886719 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 58.67457389831543 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 5162.384986877441 ms . As you can see, as the input list grows larger and larger, the overall runtime of the program increases linearly as well, resulting in a lower scalability for the sequential search algorithm. . Binary Search . Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work. . Unlike the sequential search method, binary search doesn&#39;t check for each successive element until a match is found. In every iteration the algorithm is making a binary decision; if the selected element is larger or smaller than the target. . How exactly does this work? Lets look at these amazing ms paint drawings: . i was too lazy to make a third so ur gonna have to live with 2 :) . This algorithm is extremely efficient as the maximum number of cycles in binary search is equal to log base 2 of the closest, next power of two, to length of list. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles would be 3 (log base 2 of 8 is 3) . If the array is 7 items long, the maximum possible cycles would STILL be 3 as the closest power of 2 to 7 is 8. . If the array is 9 items long, the maximum possible cycles INCREASES to 4, as the closest, next power of two, is 16. . def binarySearch(array, target): # Parameters: array is the given array and target is what we are looking for low = 0 # the starting lower bound high = len(array)-1 # the starting upper bound while high &gt;= low: # we will keep running until we run out of possible subarrays... mid = (high + low) // 2 # define the middle of the list to be the item at the index of the average of the lower and upper bound if array[mid] == target: # if item is in the middle of the list... we found what we are looking for! return mid # therefore, we return the index of where we found the item. elif array[mid] &gt; target: # if item is less than the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the lower half of the list high = mid-1 # therefore, we set the upper bound of the search to be the last item of the lower half else: # if item is neither less than or equal to the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the upper half of the list low = mid+1 # therefore, we set the lower bound of the search to be the first item of the upper half # if nothing is returned by the time the while loop ends, that means item MUST be missing from list return False # therefore we tell the user that the requested item was not found . Likewise, we can also take a recursive approach to this problem, note the similarities . def BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, hi): if lo &gt; hi: return False mid = (lo+hi)//2 if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &gt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, mid-1) elif arr[mid] &lt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, mid+1, hi) . Now, let&#39;s compare the runtime with the same lists we tried with the sequential search algorithm. . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05507469177246094 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 0.17070770263671875 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 0.06628036499023438 ms . arr4 = [1,4,5,8,10,13,145,1938] print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr4,17)) .

Developing Algorithms . Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks. Algorithms that look similar often yield differnet outputs. To solve the same problem, many different algorithms can be used. .

Challenge / wasn&#39;t able to figure it out . Using JavaScript, create an algorithm that takes in an IP address and a subnet mask and computes the network address. . Overview . As we&#39;ve seen in Unit 4.1, an IP address is a 32 bit number that uniquely identifies each device. (See this for a recap). Something extra is that an IP address also comes with a subnet mask. A subnet mask is also a 32 bit number that identifies what network an IP address in in through a process that uses the bitwise AND. . In ANDing: . 0 + 0 = 0 . 0 + 1 = 0 . 1 + 0 = 0 . 1 + 1 = 1 . The following are the steps to determine the network that an IP address is in given the subnet mask: . Example: IP address: 192.168.0.1 . Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 .

            "content": "Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks. Algorithms that look similar often yield differnet outputs. To solve the same problem, many different algorithms can be used. . Therefore, algorithms are very important for programmers, and today we&#39;re going to explore how to determine the outcome of algorithms, how to deteremine the output of similar algorithms, how to edit existing algorithms, and how to develop our own algorithms. . Determine the outcome of algorithms . Consider the following algorithm. . def mystery(num, num2): if (num % num2 == 0): print(&quot;True&quot;) else: print(&quot;False&quot;) mystery(20, 4) . True . What does the algorithm do? Please explain in words. : The algorithm takes in two numbers, num and num2, and checks to see if num is divisible by num2. If num is divisible by num2, it prints &quot;True&quot;, and if not, it prints &quot;False&quot;. | What if I put in 30 as num and 4 as num2. What would be the output?: False | Determine the outcome of similar algorithms . What is the output of this algorithm? . temp = 95 if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;it is too hot outside&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;I will go outside&quot;) else: print(&quot;it is too cold outside&quot;) . it is too hot outside . What is the output of this algorithm? it looks similar but the output is different! . temp = 95 if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;it is too hot outside&quot;) elif (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;i will go outside&quot;) if (temp &lt; 65): print(&quot;it is too cold outside&quot;) . it is too hot outside . Editing Algorithms . Task: Please edit the algorithm above to have it yield the same results as the previous algorithm! (no matter what temp you put in) . Developing Algorithms . To develop algorithms, we first need to understand what the question is asking. Then, think about how you would approach it as a human and then try to find what pattern you went through to arrive at the answer. Apply this to code, and there you have it! An algorithm! . Let&#39;s say you wanted to sum up the first five integers. How would you do this in real life? Your thought process would probably be: . The sum of the first integer is 1. | Then, increase that integer by 1. I now add 2 to my existing sum (1). My new sum is 3. | Repeat until I add 5 to my sum. The resulting sum is 15. | . Now let&#39;s translate this into code. . sum = 0 # start with a sum of 0 for i in range (1, 6): # you will repeat the process five times for integers 1-5 sum = sum + i # add the number to your sum print(sum) # print the result . 15 . Task: Write an algorithm in python that sums up the first 5 odd integers. You can use the following code as a starter. . sum = 0 counter = 1 for i in range (0, 5): sum = sum + counter counter = counter + 2 print(sum) . 25 . Homework . Create an algorithm that will start with any positive integer n and display the full sequence of numbers that result from the Collatz Conjecture. The COllatz Conjecture is as follows: . start with any positive integer | if the number is even, divide by 2 | if the number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1 | repeat steps 2 and 3 until you reach 1 | Example: if the starting number was 6, the output would be 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 . def collatz(n): while n != 1: if n % 2 == 0: n = n / 2 print(n) else: n = n * 3 + 1 print(n) collatz(5) . 16 8.0 4.0 2.0 1.0 .",

Operations of lists are listed in the table below. The commands are used to get infomation or change the list. | Lists are collections of data. They are used to store unlimited amount of data and can be called using loops and functions. It is a good way to organize infomation and use it in code at the same time. | Indexes are the position a thing is set in the list. Most code languages start at 0. -The indexes can be added together using &#39;+&#39; to get a combined value. | . Fill out the empty boxes: .

Overview and Notes: 3.8 - Iteration . Add your OWN Notes for 3.8 here: . Conditional Iteration is like while loops(loops while something is set to something else). | Iteration is repetition. This allows code to repeat a function a set amount of times. Used by every single coding language using a type of loop. | Iteration in Lists and Dictionares will use for loops. | Types of Loops include . . . For Loops: For Loops makes it so that a function or multiple functions with loop for a set amount of things or numbers. It is good for checking something in a list because it does the function one by one. | Recursive Loops: Recursive Loops are functions that loop other functions until something else happens. It&#39;s like &quot;do this until that&quot;. This can work like a for loop but is used for a lot more other functions. | While Loops: While Loops are very similar to recursive loops. It uses boolean and operations and works as &quot;do this until that&quot;. | . | . Homework Assignment .

There were also many questions that gave a block of code and asked for the result or an error in the code. A few problems even described programs and asked potential errors, inputs, outputs, and uses. Some questions asked about coding and data types, such as lists, strings, and variables. There were also some questions on binary numbers, algorithms, indexes, sequences, and results of code. Most of these questions were fairly straightforward, but some of them were misleading, and required a lot of thinking. . . What I missed . I missed 5 questions. Most of these were due to silly mistakes. For example, the question asked to choose 2 answers but I only got one of the 2 right. I also missed 1 or 2 questions because I forgot some information about the Internet, protocols, and binary coding. Some problems that included code were also very confusing, often interchanging the values of variables constantly, and then asking for the output. . Question #16: For this question it was asking how messages are transmitted over the internet. I mixed up the answer and I thought the order in which the message is transmitted mattered but it actually doesn’t matter. . Question #17: This question tested knowledge on internet protocols. It asked what the use of open protocols were on the Internet. I got this wrong because I didn’t study internet protocols and I forgot what they were and used for. . Question #35: This question gave blocks of code as answer choices and asked which ones performed a specfic function. If the value of a variable of was greater than 120, another variable would be valued as 30, while if the other variable was less than 120, than the variable would be valued as 50. I did get the right answer, but I didn’t see that the question asked for 2 answers. I got this wrong because I only chose one correct answer. . Question #40: For this question it displayed a block of code in which where it would display a value. I hadn’t read the full question so I though there would be no value displayed. But something will be displayed no matter what the values of x and y are. . Question #48: For this question it was defining variables and I had mixed up a couple of the variables when answering the question. The value of y is initially 50, but its value is changed to 75 in the fifth statement. . . What I can do better . Next time, I will make sure to read the problem carefully, and figure out exactly what it is asking. I can also look at the block of code, if given, more carefully, and comprehend what it is doing. I also have to remember to study some of the AP CSP materials, mainly those about the Internet, including protocols, and binary coding. I also have to study data transmissions and algorithms. . .

Along with this we created the framework for the letters and the hangman. We also finished with the backend part of the project . Our goals for the week . This weeks plan is to make each letter tangible, create a space where the unknown word would be shown, and create a space where the letters not included in the word and guesses by the user are placed.

The code below fetches the url and headers made in the segment of code presented above. The code checks for any response errors in those headers uding an if statement and if there is none, those elements are appended to the HTML table. The responses are also outputted using JSON data. . // fetch the API fetch(url, headers) // response is a RESTful &quot;promise&quot; on any successful fetch .then(response =&gt; { // check for response errors if (response.status !== 200) { const errorMsg = &#39;Database response error: &#39; + response.status; console.log(errorMsg); const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); const td = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); td.innerHTML = errorMsg; tr.appendChild(td); resultContainer.appendChild(tr); return; } // valid response will have json data response.json().then(data =&gt; { console.log(data); console.log(data.world_total) . The code below gets all the data specific to the API such as World Data, Country Data, and then are appended to the HTML table. This is achieved through the getElementById. They are appended to their respective row based on whater their data is about. The code also checks for fetch errors and then appends to the table again. . // World Data document.getElementById(&quot;time&quot;).innerHTML = data.world_total.statistic_taken_at; document.getElementById(&quot;total_cases&quot;).innerHTML = data.world_total.total_cases; document.getElementById(&quot;total_deaths&quot;).innerHTML = data.world_total.total_deaths; document.getElementById(&quot;active_cases&quot;).innerHTML = data.world_total.active_cases; // Country data for (const row of data.countries_stat) { console.log(row); // tr for each row const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); // td for each column const name = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const cases = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const deaths = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const active = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); // data is specific to the API name.innerHTML = row.country_name; cases.innerHTML = row.cases; deaths.innerHTML = row.deaths; active.innerHTML = row.active_cases; // this builds td&#39;s into tr tr.appendChild(name); tr.appendChild(cases); tr.appendChild(deaths); tr.appendChild(active); // add HTML to container resultContainer.appendChild(tr); } }) }) // catch fetch errors (ie ACCESS to server blocked) .catch(err =&gt; { console.error(err); const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); const td = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); td.innerHTML = err; tr.appendChild(td); resultContainer.appendChild(tr); }); &lt;/script&gt; .",

            "content": "Computer Systems and Network Diagram: . Computer Networks and Systems . A computing device is a physical artifact that can run a program. Computers | Tablets | Servers | Routers | Smart sensors | . | A computer network is a type of computing system | A path between two computing devices on a computer network (a sender and a reciever) is a sequence of directly connected computing devices that begins at the sender and ends at the receiver. | Routing is the process of finding a path from sender to receiver. | The bandwidth of a computer network is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time. | Bandwidth is usually measured in bits per second. | . . How Computers Are Connected . A computing system is a group of computing devices and programs working together for a common purpose. | A computer network is a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data. | . . Packets . A packet is a small amount of data sent over a network. Each packet also includes the source and the destination information. | Packet Switching: The message (file) is broken up into packets and sent in any order. The packets are reassembled by the recipient’s device. Ex: Hello. How are you? ==&gt; | Hello. You? How are | . | . | . . The Internet . The Internet is a computer network consisting of interconnected networks that use standardized, open (nonpropritary) communication protocols. | Access to the Internet depends on the ability to connact a computing dvice to an internet connected device. | Routing on the Internet is usually dynamic; it is not specified in advance | Information is passed through the Internet as a data stream. Data streams contain chunks of data, which are encapsulated in packets | Packets contain a chunk of data and metadata used for routing the packet between the origin and the destination on the Internet, as well as for data reassembly | Packets may arrive at the destination in order, our of order, or not at all | The World Wide Web is a system of linked pages, programs, and files | The World Wide Web uses the Internet | . . Protocols . A protocol is an agreed-upon set of rules that specify the behavior of a system. | The protocols used in the Internet are open, which allows users to easily connect additional computing devices to the Internet. | IP, TCP, and UDP are common protocols used on the Internet TCP does error checking and error recovery so it is slower | UDP performs error checking, but it discards erroneous packets | . | HTTP is a protocol used by the World Wide Web | . . Internet and Transport Layers . Transport Layer - How the packets are sent, and for what Reliability - reliable - sender gets a receipt back, resend as needed TCP | Unreliability - send and forget. UDP | . | Internet Layer IPv4: Example 192.168.24.1 32 bits, separated into 4 “octets” 8 bits long (0-255) | Separated into 2 parts: Network (1-31) | Device (32-network bits) | . | . | Three targets that can be addressed using IP Unicast - A specific device. Internet wide access. TCP is used. | Multicast - A group of devices. It is specific range of IP addresses. Internet-wide access. UDP is used. | Broadcast - All devices. LAN-wide. Data stops at the router. UDP is used. | . | . . Application Layer . Key protocols used: http. How to ask and receive data from web servers. Normally uses TCP, Port 80 at the transport layer | https. Like http but with security. Usually uses TCP Port 443 | . | Web Servers: Programs running on machines connected to the Internet | Provides clients web pages - data linked to other pages using URLs (Uniform Resource Locations) | Ex, https://www.mycompany.com | The World Wide Web (WWW) is this network of linked data and programs, running over the Internet | . | DNS - Domain Name Service Applications that translate a human readable URL (e.g. www.mycompany.com) to an IP address | DNS holds a database of mapping of names to IPs. Servers running DNS are spread across the internet | There are large computers serving and managing these name/IP Mappings for each Domain (.com, .net, .gov, etc.) | You use a DNS server every time you ask for a web page on a browser | . | . . Scalibility of the Internet . The scalability of a system is the capacity for the system to change in size and scale to meet new demands. | The Internet was designed to be scalable Able to change in size and scale to meet new demands | . | Local Area Network (LAN): Physical Connections | Limited by hardware and physics | 1 to 100s of systems | . | Intranet: LANs connected by Routers within an organization | . | Autonomous Systems (AS): Large intranets linked together under the control and policies of major organizations. Large routers link networks with large telecommunications connections | . | The Internet: Autonomous Systems linked together | Large Routers linking Ass via special telecom means (Fiber, T3, Satellites) | Major infrastructures - DNS (.com, .net, etc.), Cyber Operations | . | . . Authentication . Authentication measures protect devices and information from unauthorized access. Ex: Strong passwords | Multifactor authentication. | . | A strong passwrod is something that is easy for a user to remember, but would be difficult for someone else to guess based on knowledge of that user. | Multifactor authentication is a method of computer access control in which a user is only granted access after successfully presenting several separate pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism, typically in at least two of the following categories: knowledge (something they know) | possession (something they have) | ingerence (something they are) | . | Multifactor authentication requires a least two steps to unlock protected information; each step adds a new layer of security that must be broken to gain unauthorized access. | . . Encryption . Encryption: the process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access | Decryption: the process of decoding the data. | Two common encryption approaches are: Symmetric key encryption involves one key for both encryption and decryption | Public key encryption pairs a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The sender does not need the receiver’s private key to encrypt a message, but the receiver’s private key is required to decrypt the message | . | . | Certificate authorities issue digital certificates that validates the ownership of encryption keys used in secure communications and are based on a trust model. | . . Viruses and Malware . Computer virus and malware scanning software can help protect a computing system against infection. | A computer virus is a malicious program that can copy itself and gain access to a computer in an unauthorized way. Computer viruses often attach themselves to legitimate programs and start running independently on a computer. | Malware is software intended to damage a computing system or to take partial control over its operation. Can infiltrate a system by posing as legitimate programs or by attaching itself to legitimate programs, like an email attachment | . | Virus scans can help to prevent malicious code from getting into and affecting your system | . . Prevention . All real-world systems have errors or design flaws that can be exploited to compromise them. Regular software updates help fix errors that could compromise a computing system. | Users can control the permissions programs they have for collecting user information. Users should review the permission settings of programs to protect their privacy. | . . Quiz Results . .",

            "content": "Main Ideas . Me and my Group have decided to code a program that will simulate a game of hangman. Hangman is a game between two or more players. One player known as the executioner thinks up of a word or a sentence and at least one other person needs to guess what that word or sentence might be going one letter at a time. If the guesser(s) guess a letter that is not in the phase, the executioner draws a body part of a stick figure onto a gallow. If the executioner draws all the body parts, the guessers lose and the game is over. If the guessers complete the phase, they win. The Purpose of this program is to teach and/or test the user&#39;s vocabulary skills. This is done through hangman by displaying a definition of the unknown word or by displaying a topic that relates to the unknown sentence. They must have good vocabalury skills to win the game as well as good grammer. The Project will have an impact on the coders and the users. It will impact the coders because it will provide them with knowledge and experince about code. It will impact the users because it should be able to enhance their vocabulary and some rules about grammer and words . Program, Purpose, and Function: The purpose of this program is to test the user&#39;s vocabulary skills. This is done through hangman by displaying a definition of the unknown word or by displaying a topic that relates to the unknown sentence. The users must have good vocabalury skills to win the game as well as good grammer . | Data Abstraction: The program will need to have lists, dictionaries, and an API. Mostly likely, the lists and dictionaries will be located inside an API. This API will have the definitions and words that will be used for hangman. My group will use the API and code around it so that the user can guess the word in a style that simulates hangman. . | Managing Complexity: The API is what is being coded around so that will organize the code. However, this only displays what to display. My group will need to program the functions of the inputs and outputs. This will still be connected to the API. . | Procedural Abstraction: There will be a function in the program that determines if the inputed word and the unknown word and the same. This is important to the rest of the program because this will display that the game is over and the code can end or move on to a different segment of the code. This line of code gives the other code segments purpose. . | Algorithm Implementation: The program have a API and code in the program will loop the APi in order to gain more words and definitions and display them. More will be explained once the code segment is actually created. . | Testing: The main call used in the hangman program would be the event when the user inputs a word. When the user puts in a word, a function will check if it matched with the unknown word. If they do not, the user guesses again and calls the same function from earlier. . |",

Menu burger $3.99 fries $1.99 drink $0.99 checkout $0 Please slelect an item. Then once your finished with the order type &#39;break&#39; Total is: $12.96 . Some Common Errors . No one is perfect. Errors are bound to happen but identifying, understanding, and fixing thoses errors is what matters more. There are 4 main types of errors when developing a program. These are Logic, Syntax, run-time, and overflow errors. . Over-flow errors occur in a program when it is required to perform a calculation that is not possible for it to run. The values in the calculations are outside the set range of values of the program. This is caused due to memory allocation constraints of the program&#39;s language, resulting in restrictions. . | Run-time errors happen when a program stops while it is running. This event is also known as &quot;crashing &quot; and the error is normally referred to as a &quot;bug &quot;. A run-time error can be caused by dividing by zero, wrong inputed data type, or many other errors that are commonly caused by incorrect data . | Syntax errors are very small mistakes made by the programmer that doesn&#39;t match with the language. It could be a typo, unnecessary code, missing necessary code, missing characters or added characters. Characters include colon, semicolon, parenthesis, indentations, quotes, and so much more. These mistakes will cause the program to shut down. . | Logic errors are errors that are caused due to the programmer making a mistake in the algorithm. This causes the program to behave unexpectedly. A logic error can result in events in the program taking place in times that they are not suppose to happen in. . | . How To correct Errors . Extra Outputs: Lastly, a programmer could just add extra outputs. This strategy is used so that the programmer could find where the error is in the program. When the error is fixed, the extra output is normally removed. . | Hand Tracing: Another testing strategy is hand tracing. Hand tracing is putting in values of variables in a loop to find out if the outcome is correct. This is most useful with loops and other small code segments that repeat a number of times. . | IDEs: Syntax errors are the easiest errors to fix because most IDEs display information on where and when there is a syntax error. . | Test Cases: Unlike syntax errors, logic errors are more difficult to found because the IDEs doesn&#39;t help you and it would normally look like nothing is wrong. This is when programmers use test cases. Test cases are a set of actions(like inputs) that are used to check if they get the correct result. . | . Testing a Program . Programmers are planning program tests at the beginning of development. They determine the program&#39;s specifications and inputs and ask themselves how will they know if the program is working correctly. The Defined inputs used to test the program demonstrate different outcomes that would be expected, no matter if it works or not. When the inputs and outputs are matched, the programers test the code. After the test, programmers use the infomation that the program give them and revise, refine, and/or improve their work. Then they test again, make more changes, test again, and again. Once the programmers made clear results that they wanted, they let users test it and make more changes from that. After all that, the program is finished and can be released but even still, most of the time they will still be changes that must be fixed. . Hacks: Test Planning . What errors may arise in your project? . In program development, many errors eccour but most of them are small. These small errors could be an incorrect line of code, a typo, or a missed character. Most errors are like this but sometimes the error is bigger. Entire procedures can have the wrong purpose, code is typed using an incorrect language, program is set up incorrectly, and code could be blocked to some members of the team. All of these errors can break the entire code so ALL ERRORS MUST BE FIXED in our code. | . | What are some test cases that can be used? . The desried inputs for my team&#39;s program would be english words but we must test more than that. Test cases that can be used would include any word from any language with any amount of letters as well as numbers or other special characters. This would mostly likely break the code and that is why my group must test them. It would be the best way to fix them. | . | .",

            "content": "Collegeboard Notes . Essential Knowledge . A development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature | There are multiple development processes. The following phrases are commonly used when developing a program: Investigating and refleting | Designing | Prototyping | Testing | . | A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phrases of the process. | A development proess that is incremental is one that breaks the problem into smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole. | The design of a program incorporates investigation to determine its requirements. | Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraints, as well as the concerns and interests of the people who will use the program. | Some ways investigation can be performed are as follows: Collecting data through surveys | User testing | Inteviews | Direct observations | . | Program requirements describes how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide | . . How is a Program Developed? . Rarely a solo endeavor . Usually developed by teams of people It all starts with an idea | Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind | Developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan | Sometimes the development is more exploratory than anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens (both good and bad) Think about early AI projects, like personal assistants Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect | . | Investigation is an important step in the process | Developers must: Determine the requirements of the program | Understand the constraints | Understand the user concerns and interests | . | How do developers investigate? Surveys | User testing | Interviews | Direct observations After initial investigation and reflection, | . | Developers design the program by Brainstorming (draw on investigation) | Storyboarding the program | Planning user experience | Laying out the user interface | Organizing into modules | Develop a testing strategy | . | Developers decide on the program requirements that Describe how a program should behave | Include a list of user interactions | . | The program specifications outline all of the requirements | Developers create a prototype of the program (or components): An incremental process is frequently used so developers can refine small parts (modules) of the program Testing, testing, and more testing! | . | Developers test the program every step of the way | Testing occurs at the Micro level | Macro level | . | Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection | . . When does documentation happen? . Documentation happens throughout the development of the program: . At the beginning: list specifications | During: to keep track of process | After: to explain the overall process Documentation throughout can improve: | Efficiency of overall programming process | Programmers’ ability to test and refine the program | Programmers’ response to bugs | . . Collegeboard quiz results . This is the screenshot of the results of the quiz I took on Collegeboard . . . Final Project Design . Idea/Brain Write . A random quiz generator. Save notes in the website and the alogrithm uses the notes to genrate questions for a quiz. The quiz is then scored and the topics missed are highlighted. Me and my team reviewed over the different possible final project ideas that we made and this is the best one we came up with. . . Outline and how it fits requirements . Program Purpose and Function -The purpose of the program is to randomly generate vocabulary words based on a defenition. The program will take the user’s notes and, based on it, select the key terms and a hangman type game where it gives you a definition and you have to guess word based off it. . Data Abstraction . The program will contain lists and dictionaries. Every key term will have a definition and these will be stored in a dictionary which will be stored in a list. Or they will be stored in a local database and we will use the objects in the database to create the hangman quiz. | . Managing Complexity . The dictionaries and databases will manage the complexity of the program by organizing the data inputted by the user. It will also help calling back to creating the hangman quiz. | . Procedural Abstraction . A function will be created to call back to the data inputted by the user. The function will iterate over the dictionary/database and use the values in them as a parameter to make a hangman quiz. | . Algorithm Implementation . Like stated before, the program will contain a function that uses iteration and sequencing to make a hangman quiz based off the data inputted by the user that is saved in a database or dictionary. | . Testing . The function will be called each time the user inputs a note and each time the user generates a hangman quiz. When the user inputs a note, the function is called and saves the note inside a dictionary or database. When the user presses the button that generates the hangman quiz, the function is again called and iterates through the user’s notes to generate a hangman quiz that is related to the key terms the user inputted. | . .",

Challenges I faced . I have done block coding in the past with websites like scratch so I knew generally how it worked. But still I faced a challenge. This was being getting the result screen to work properly since I wanted different types of text to show depending on your score. First what would happen was your score would show but all the different text would pop up. So I fixed this with the if/else block and it that fixed my orginal problem of the all the text popping out at once. But this led to the score always showing up as 100% even if you got everything wrong so I added the setText block with the if/else block. . What can I do to improve my quiz . Some things I would like to add is to randomize the order of my questions so its not always the same order. I also want to add sound effects to my quiz to improve the user experience. Finally something that I want to improve on for my quiz is to make the code much more efficent. .",

For Loops and Index . Using for loops and iterating through using index in python. Here is a simple example: . Food = [&quot;Burger&quot;, &quot;Hot Dog&quot;, &quot;Fries&quot;, &quot;Pizza&quot;, &quot;Goldfish&quot;, &quot;Donut&quot;, &quot;M&amp;M&quot;, &quot;Beef Kebab&quot;, &quot;Chicken Kebab&quot;, &quot;Burrito&quot;, &quot;Tacos&quot;, &quot;Chicken Sandwich&quot;] for i in Food: print(i) . Burger Hot Dog Fries Pizza Goldfish Donut M&amp;M Beef Kebab Chicken Kebab Burrito Tacos Chicken Sandwich . Outputting in Reverse Order . It is possible to output data in a reverse order. Here is an example using a palindrome: . def is_palindrome(prompt): print(prompt[::-1]) print(prompt) return prompt[::-1] == prompt word = input(&quot;Enter a word: &quot;) if is_palindrome(word.lower()) is True: print(&quot;{0} is a palindrome!&quot;.format(word)) else: print(&quot;The provided word is not a palindrome.&quot;) . olleh hello The provided word is not a palindrome. . Other list methods . Lists can have a variety of methods performed on them. A couple being .append() or while loop. Here is an example using .append() and .lower() with a for loop: . Dangerous_Animals = [&quot;Box Jellyfish&quot;, &quot;African CAPE BuFfalo&quot;, &quot;BLAck MambA&quot;, &quot;Blue-RINGED octopus&quot;] Dangerous_Animals.append(&quot;Cone SnAIl&quot;) for i in range(len(Dangerous_Animals)): Dangerous_Animals[i] = Dangerous_Animals[i].lower() print(Dangerous_Animals) . [&#39;box jellyfish&#39;, &#39;african cape buffalo&#39;, &#39;black mamba&#39;, &#39;blue-ringed octopus&#39;, &#39;cone snail&#39;] . Adding to a Dictionary . You can also add or create new keys and values to a dictionary data set. This can also be done with input. Here is an example: . My_Dict = { &quot;Absence&quot;: &quot;The lack or unavailability of something or someone.&quot;, &quot;Approval&quot;: &quot;Having a positive opinion of something or someone.&quot;, &quot;Answer&quot;: &quot;The response or receipt to a phone call, question, or letter.&quot;, &quot;Attention&quot;: &quot;Noticing or recognizing something of interest.&quot;, &quot;Amount&quot;: &quot;A mass or a collection of something.&quot;, &quot;Borrow&quot;: &quot;To take something with the intention of returning it after a period of time.&quot;, &quot;Baffle&quot;: &quot;An event or thing that is a mystery and confuses.&quot;, &quot;Ban&quot;: &quot;An act that is prohibited by social pressure or law.&quot;, &quot;Cars&quot;: &quot;Four-wheeled vehicles used for traveling.&quot;, } print(My_Dict) My_Dict[&quot;Care&quot;] = &quot;extra responsibility and attention.&quot; #Added new key and value into dictionary print(My_Dict) My_Dict[&quot;Chip&quot;] = input() # Added new value with input print(My_Dict) . {&#39;Absence&#39;: &#39;The lack or unavailability of something or someone.&#39;, &#39;Approval&#39;: &#39;Having a positive opinion of something or someone.&#39;, &#39;Answer&#39;: &#39;The response or receipt to a phone call, question, or letter.&#39;, &#39;Attention&#39;: &#39;Noticing or recognizing something of interest.&#39;, &#39;Amount&#39;: &#39;A mass or a collection of something.&#39;, &#39;Borrow&#39;: &#39;To take something with the intention of returning it after a period of time.&#39;, &#39;Baffle&#39;: &#39;An event or thing that is a mystery and confuses.&#39;, &#39;Ban&#39;: &#39;An act that is prohibited by social pressure or law.&#39;, &#39;Cars&#39;: &#39;Four-wheeled vehicles used for traveling.&#39;} {&#39;Absence&#39;: &#39;The lack or unavailability of something or someone.&#39;, &#39;Approval&#39;: &#39;Having a positive opinion of something or someone.&#39;, &#39;Answer&#39;: &#39;The response or receipt to a phone call, question, or letter.&#39;, &#39;Attention&#39;: &#39;Noticing or recognizing something of interest.&#39;, &#39;Amount&#39;: &#39;A mass or a collection of something.&#39;, &#39;Borrow&#39;: &#39;To take something with the intention of returning it after a period of time.&#39;, &#39;Baffle&#39;: &#39;An event or thing that is a mystery and confuses.&#39;, &#39;Ban&#39;: &#39;An act that is prohibited by social pressure or law.&#39;, &#39;Cars&#39;: &#39;Four-wheeled vehicles used for traveling.&#39;, &#39;Care&#39;: &#39;extra responsibility and attention.&#39;} {&#39;Absence&#39;: &#39;The lack or unavailability of something or someone.&#39;, &#39;Approval&#39;: &#39;Having a positive opinion of something or someone.&#39;, &#39;Answer&#39;: &#39;The response or receipt to a phone call, question, or letter.&#39;, &#39;Attention&#39;: &#39;Noticing or recognizing something of interest.&#39;, &#39;Amount&#39;: &#39;A mass or a collection of something.&#39;, &#39;Borrow&#39;: &#39;To take something with the intention of returning it after a period of time.&#39;, &#39;Baffle&#39;: &#39;An event or thing that is a mystery and confuses.&#39;, &#39;Ban&#39;: &#39;An act that is prohibited by social pressure or law.&#39;, &#39;Cars&#39;: &#39;Four-wheeled vehicles used for traveling.&#39;, &#39;Care&#39;: &#39;extra responsibility and attention.&#39;, &#39;Chip&#39;: &#39;Absence&#39;} .

            "content": "Ryan Hakimipour . Mrs. James . Hs English 3 . 26 August 2022 . How to be Happy . The two most contributing factors of happiness are meditation and resilience. Meditation is one of the most important factors in determining a person’s happiness. Do ever start to feel overwhelmed which ends up disrupting your happiness, if so I would highly recommend meditation. Wherever I start feeling that same way I start to feel less positive and less motivated into doing my daily tasks. This is when I start to realize that some things are off and this is when I start to give myself 10 minutes of my day to sit and relax and reflect on my day. This may seem odd but those 10 minutes help clear my mind and to reflect on my day and helps me relax. When that stress leaves my system it allows me to start thinking about myself which helps with my happiness. In addition, mediation helps with general happiness. Mediation can help with relieving stress and improving general happiness. When you practice daily meditation it can help reduce stress, quiet mental chatter, increase self-esteem, and much more. Less stress allows you to focus on yourself and increase happiness. Therefore it has been proven by many and by myself that meditation does help improve overall happiness. . Resilience is one of the most important factors in determining a person’s happiness. Have you ever just wanted to plow your way through any situation and hope for the best, that’s what resilience feels like. Being resilient helps people to be able to thrive during difficult times. Being resilient can also help ward off stress and move from depression to happiness. Being resilient is a choice and the right one at that since it helps increase happiness levels. Resilience is a key factor in being happy. But to be able to use resilience to its fullest potential you have to be able to decide between being resilient. In addition, I like to be resilient since I can make the best out of any situation. Being resilient is a choice so if you can make that choice it will allow you to fly through anything that tries to lower your happiness. Personally I like to always be open-minded no matter what and seek out the positive outcomes out of any situation such as when I visited Canada last summer our flight had gotten canceled right as we reached our gate. Though it did suck wasting about a couple of hours of our day we were able to see our family one more day before we left. All in all, being happy is a choice that only you can make. .",

            "content": "Ryan Hakimipour . Mr Yeung . APCSP . 29 August 2022 . Alumni . When we met with the Alumni of prior APCSP students earlier today they helped with my understanding of what the class has to offer and with opportunities that can help me later on in the future. Something that they had talked about was how there are a vast variety of majors that APCSP leads to. Coding can also be used in majors, apart from APCSP/APCSA. There can also be many difficulties when it comes to coding and many hardships that we have to face but you just have to keep pushing yourself and focus on yourself, and not worry about how the other “Steve Jobs”s of the world are doing. Many of these difficulties can be solved with a simple Google search since there have been others with the same problem as yourself. On the off chance that you can’t find an answer to a problem, don’t be afraid to reach out to others and ask for help. Another good tip is to prevent yourself from cutting corners and understand the code that you’re writing and try to expand on it. A good way to use your coding knowledge to the best of your ability is to try and get an internship which will not only help improve your skills but also boost your resume. It’s also good to have personal projects on the side so you can add them to your portfolio. Having something that you can apply to your work and a plan are great ways to keep yourself moving since it allows you to stay organized. .",
