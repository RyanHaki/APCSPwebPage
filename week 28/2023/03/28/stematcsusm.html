<meta name="description" content="About CSU San Marcos CSU San Marcos is a relatively new campus that used to be a poultry farm before it was transformed into a college. Despite being relatively small, it has a good Physics program and a smaller population, which allows for closer relationships between students and faculty. The campus has over 250 stairs and many engineering buildings have already been constructed, with plans for more in the future. CSU San Marcos offers multiple pathways for students, such as Computer Engineering (Starting this fall), Applied Physics, Math, Electrical Engineering, Software Engineering, etc. Additionally, there are many departments to choose from, including Physics, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Biotechnology, Biological Sciences, Math, Computer Science, etc. For those interested in STEM, there are several active clubs on campus, such as the Cybersecurity Club, Robotics, 3D Printing, Women in STEM, etc." />
