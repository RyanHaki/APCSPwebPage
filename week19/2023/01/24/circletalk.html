<p>Some issues that students are having with controlling computing time is dopamine issues. Its something that many issues deal with since they don’t have the attention span to last them through time where they have to school work. Something that I deal with personally is not being able to manage the time I spend playing games since I get more dopamine from games compared to school work so to my brain would rather play video games and get that feeling/rush than looking at a textbook. One way that I learned to stop myself from playing video games for a long time is that I set a screen time for myself to restrict the amount of time that I spend playing games. I also dedicated a certain amount of time each day to my school work.</p>

<h3 id="algorithmic-bias">
<a class="anchor" href="#algorithmic-bias" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Algorithmic Bias</h3>

<p>Computer bias frequently manifests as algorithmic bias. These algorithms tend to cater to specific target markets, for instance, Facebook displays ads that attract an older audience while TikTok is geared towards a younger demographic.</p>

<p>The topic of gender-based biases in artificial intelligence systems was extensively debated. Despite evidence of gender stereotyping being present in the decision-making process, the team ultimately concluded that the multitude of voice options and the likelihood that the creators used consumer data to determine the most popular voice led to the female default being chosen as it simply resonated with the majority.</p>

<p>Algorithms are prevalent in applications that aim to keep users engaged, such as YouTube, Instagram, Netflix, Amazon, and others. While it can have negative consequences if, for example, a user is exposed to only a single political viewpoint on YouTube, in general, these algorithms benefit both the user and the platform. By personalizing content based on previous viewing habits, sites such as Netflix and YouTube improve their ability to recommend media that the user is likely to enjoy, which can be considered a mutually advantageous outcome.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#are-hp-computers-racist" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Are HP Computers Racist?</h3>

<p>While the data regarding HP testers is certainly concerning and indicative of a lack of inclusivity and responsibility, there is no clear evidence of deliberate discrimination. Regardless, this is a harmful flaw in the camera’s programming, and it is the responsibility of HP for failing to identify it.</p>

<p>To prevent similar issues in the future, it is crucial to conduct comprehensive testing on systems, especially those designed to interact with individuals of varying appearances, with a diverse group of testers. One effective method to gather extensive data could be to record a diverse range of individuals in a public setting.</p>

<ul>
  <li>CompSci has 150ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>It would be beneficial to receive feedback on the games featured on our website from other CSP students, as it may provide us with more comprehensive solutions or recommendations for various challenges. This approach can be applied to all aspects of our project and could be initiated through Slack.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing?</li>
</ul>

<p>Testing the Reviews and Events databases with a diverse group of students would be beneficial as it would provide more robust testing for their filtering and validation systems with a higher volume of entries. If we were to enlist a significant number of Del Norte students to contribute events and reviews to the site, we would have a stronger foundation to build upon. However, this approach would also come with the potential risk of an increase in spam.</p>
