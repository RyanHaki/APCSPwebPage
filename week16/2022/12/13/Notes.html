<ul>
  <li>Agile methodology differs between companies depending on scrum size</li>
  <li>Always start looking for a new job before you lose your current one (or see signs of loosing your current one)</li>
  <li>Be ADAPTIVE and KEEP LEARNING</li>
  <li>Know how to listen to requirements and translate in terms of how the technology can meet them</li>
  <li>Ridiculous interviews nowadays (compile code that solves a problem in 30-45 min)</li>
  <li>Twitter University / Meta University teaches how the systems work because they are built there</li>
  <li>Knowing how to code effectively is not just a skill, it’s a way of thinking (problem solving, growth mindset, etc…)</li>
</ul>
