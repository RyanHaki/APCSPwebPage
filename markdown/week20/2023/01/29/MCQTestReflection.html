<p>I missed 4 questions. Most of these were due to silly mistakes. For example, the question asked to choose 2 answers but I only got one of the 2 right. Some problems that included code were also very confusing, often interchanging the values of variables constantly, and then asking for the output.</p>

<p>Question #27: The correct answer to question 27 was D, as shown above. I actually had a difficult time understanding what this question was asking, as I struggled in deciding which answers to eliminate and which answers were possible correct ones. As I am looking back and reviewing this question, I am starting to understand where I went wrong, but I have still not 100% understood this question to the point where I can answer a very similar question like this correctly. One way I can improve myself in this area is to watch some of the College Board videos (also shown in the image above) that relate to questions like these, as those videos will definitely help improve my ability to answer a question like this and teach me how to approach them. I definitely learned a lot about myself and my understanding of this topic from this one question, and I believe that this will help me become better prepared for the upcoming AP exam.</p>

<p>Question #30: For this question, again, I got one of the options correct (option C) but I did not select option B, which was the other correct answer. I did not realize that Option B was correct, because for each next entry, it increases the radius of the circle by 1 (which is supposed to happen as per the diagram), and it starts off with (4, 1, 0) as the initial integers stored which is the starting position of the first nested circle as shown in the diagram.</p>

<p>Question #43: I had mixed up my answer and the correct answer should of been that a limitation to a computer simulation was that the computer makes simplifying assumptions about the real world</p>

<p>Question #45: When reading the answers I had mixed up can and cannot and had choose can instead of cannot leading me to getting the incorrect answer.</p>

<p>Next time, I will make sure to read the problem carefully, and figure out exactly what it is asking. I can also look at the block of code, if given, more carefully, and comprehend what it is doing. I also have to remember to study some of the AP CSP materials, mainly those about the Internet, including protocols, and binary coding. I also have to study data transmissions and algorithms.</p>
